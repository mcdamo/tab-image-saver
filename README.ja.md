## Path rules

Path rules are a flexible method for choosing the download filenames.

Rules can contain any combination of text strings and **keywords**.

Rules are processed top-down, if the rule does not evaluate to a valid path then it will proceed to the next rule in the list.

### Keywords

- Keywords are enclosed by angled brackets `< >`
- They can use simple OR logic with the pipe symbol `|`
- Keywords prepended with hashes `#` will be zero-padded

Example source: `<img src="http://example.com/path/to/filename.gif" alt="Caption">`

| Keyword  | Description                               | Example     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| alt      | image's alt content                       | Caption     |
| name     | image's filename without extension        | filename    |
| ext      | image's extension                         | .gif        |
| path     | full path to image                        | path/to     |
| host     | hostname                                  | example.com |
| index    | incremented number starting at '1'        | 1           |
| xName    | filename from Content-Disposition header  | filename    |
| xExt     | extension from Content-Disposition header | .gif        |
| xMimeExt | extension from Content-Type header        | .gif        |

Any tag not defined above will be treated as static text. For example `<undef>.jpg` will output `undef.jpg`

### Examples

`<name><ext|xExt|xMimeExt|.jpg>`

This will attempt to find the filename extension from the URL, Content-Disposition header, Content-Type header, and finally if all else fails will use `.jpg`

`img_<####index>.jpg`

This will use the index of the image in the active download session. The index is incremented for each image saved and processed in tab order. The output will be zero padded, such as `img_0001.jpg`
