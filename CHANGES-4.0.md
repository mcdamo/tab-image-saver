# Tab Image Saver v4

This update introduces 

- **new syntax for [Path rules](README.md#path-rules)**
- import/export config
- download indexing options for per-tab and continuing

## Instructions

If you have created custom Path rules they are not compatible with this version and need to be updated.

**Your exisiting Path rules have not been updated yet.**

### Export your config

It is strongly recommended to backup your existing config prior to using the provided *Update* tool.

Open *Preferences* and choose *Export backup* to download your config as JSON. This will include all your Path rules in the old v3.0 syntax.

### Update Path rules

In *Preferences* click *Update Path rules*. This will convert your custom rules to the new v4.0 syntax.

When the *Update Path rules* button is disabled then you do not have any more rules in the old syntax and the addon is ready to use.
